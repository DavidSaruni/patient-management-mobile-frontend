# üì± Patient Management Android App ‚Äî Setup Instructions

## üß≠ Overview

This is the Android mobile application for the Patient Management System, built with Kotlin, Android Jetpack components, and WorkManager for background synchronization.

It connects to the Django REST Framework backend API to manage:
- **Patients**
- **Vitals** 
- **Visit Forms (A & B)**
- **Offline data sync**

## ‚öôÔ∏è 1Ô∏è‚É£ Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

| Tool | Recommended Version |
|------|-------------------|
| Android Studio | Giraffe (or newer) |
| Android SDK | 34 |
| Gradle | 7.4.2 |
| JDK | Java 11 |
| Kotlin | 1.9+ |
| Git | Latest |

## üóÇÔ∏è 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavidSaruni/patient-management-android.git
cd patient-management-android
```

Then open the project folder in Android Studio.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3Ô∏è‚É£ Android Studio Configuration

1. Open the project in Android Studio.
2. Allow Gradle to sync automatically.
3. If prompted, install missing SDK components or tools.
4. Ensure `compileSdkVersion = 34` and `minSdkVersion = 24` (or as defined in build.gradle).

## üì¶ 4Ô∏è‚É£ Build and Run the App

### Using Emulator
1. Create an Android Virtual Device (AVD) via AVD Manager.
2. Select a recommended image (e.g., Pixel 6, API 34).
3. Click **Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è** to build and launch the app.

### Using Physical Device
1. Enable **Developer Options** ‚Üí **USB Debugging** on your phone.
2. Connect it to your computer via USB.
3. Select your device from the Run target menu in Android Studio.
4. Click **Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è** to install and start the app.

## üîó 5Ô∏è‚É£ Connect to the Backend API

The app syncs data (patients, vitals, visits) with the Django REST API.
You need to point the app to your backend server.

1. **Find your computer's local IP address:**
   - **Windows** ‚Üí `ipconfig`
   - **macOS/Linux** ‚Üí `ifconfig`

2. **In the backend, run:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
   ```

3. **Update the base URL in the Android app:**
   
   **File:** `ApiClient.kt`
   ```kotlin
   object ApiClient {
       const val BASE_URL = "http://192.168.xxx.xxx:8000/api/"
       ...
   }
   ```
   
   Replace `192.168.xxx.xxx` with your actual LAN IP.

4. **Rebuild the project and rerun the app.**

## üîÅ 6Ô∏è‚É£ Offline Sync Setup (WorkManager)

The app automatically syncs:
- New patients
- Recorded vitals  
- Visit forms

via a background worker every 15 minutes (or manually after registration).

The sync is handled by:
- `SyncManager.kt` ‚Äì schedules periodic syncs
- `SyncWorker.kt` ‚Äì performs uploads to the API

Ensure your backend is reachable over the same network.
